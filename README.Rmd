# ezmtt

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ezmtt is a package for analyzing MTT assay data - namely, fitting and plotting curves and calculating IC%. 

It mainly serves as a 'companion package' for the protocol [here](https://kai.quarto.pub/bok/mtt.html), but is flexible enough to support a variety of plate layouts.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ezmtt from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KaiAragaki/ezmtt")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(ezmtt)

mtt |>
  mtt_fit(conditions = list(
    drug_a = c(0, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000),
    drug_b = c(0, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000),
    NA,
    NA
  )) |>
  mtt_plot(ic_pct = 50)
```
